/**
 * Context
 * A smart phone device has a power button and a display screen. To conserve
 * the battery power, the smart phone needs to have features:
 * - When the device is on, pressing the power button will turn it off
 * - When the device is off, pressing the power button will turn it on
 *
 * For security purpose, it must have a locking mechanism.
 *
 * Problem
 * I need to accomodate the changing flow of the smart phone internal states
 * when the power button is pressed and provide a maintainable and flexible
 * methods when adding new features.
 *
 * Solution
 * Create a strategy on the smart phone to handle its various internal states.
